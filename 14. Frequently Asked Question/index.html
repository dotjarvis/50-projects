                Capsule makes it easy to create stylized video content with the
                people who matter most to you, whether that’s employees,
                customers, students, fans, friends, or however you define
                community. Just create an account, set up your Capsule, and
                invite as many people as you want to record videos!

                Any additional hosted videos beyond your plan's video limit
                during the monthly billing period will incur overage costs at
                the per video cost listed above. These overage charges will
                appear on your next month's bill. If you are on an annual plan,
                you will receive a monthly bill exclusively for the overage
                charges. To keep your hosted videos within your plan's limit,
                you can always delete videos before you reach your maximum
                amount.

                You may cancel your Capsule subscription at any time from your
                Capsule account. If you are cancelling during your free trial
                period, you will not be charged once the trial ends. If you are
                cancelling while on a paid plan, your subscription will expire
                at the end of your current billing term. There are no credits or
                refunds for partial or unused terms.

                No. If you cancel your Capsule subscription, you will no longer
                have access to your Capsule account, including your content and
                data. All of your shared Capsules will be locked. However, you
