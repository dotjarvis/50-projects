              <blockquote>
                For me, Fix'd was twenty weeks of fun. I never had to solve that
                many design issues before and it was awesome! I did not expect
                to end up where we did after the initial brief. I did expect a
                nice collaboration between UNITiD and our team, though! I really
                enjoyed my part. I think I grew not just as a concepter, but as
                a designer as well thanks to the scope.

              <blockquote>
                You never really have enough time to finalize a project to your
                complete satisfaction. Our collaboration went well, I felt it
                was a nice team to work with, although I did feel that I could
                have contributed more to it sometimes. The technical aspect of
                prototyping was difficult for me, so instead I opted to run some
                users tests through paper prototying, after which we obtained a
                lot of valuable insights.

                Firstly, I want to thank everyone who made our project possible.
                It’s really great to work with such passionate teammates. I
                never expected that we would come up with a project that is is
                considered at this level of complexity. I also learned a lot
                from my teammates and in the field of interaction design. I’m
                very proud of the final result!

              <blockquote>
                This was a huge and ambitious project, and I felt I had learned
                something new every day. I worked very closely with Bart, trying
                to create new and interesting designs. I totally expected the
                project to go in an entirely diferent direction, but thanks to a
                lot of feedback and discussions, we managed to create something
                that's truly and fully ours.
